# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal `nvim` config.

requirements:

- `lua` based configuration.
- `lsp` 
- `treesitter`
- `telescope`
- `harpoon`
- Rust, Python, HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript support.

non-requirements:

- tabs or buffer line
- tree view or file exlorer
- VSCode-like UI.

## TODO:

- [ ] Fix `lsp` configuration for rust.
    Note: that the `lsp` actions, like "Goto Definition" etc. are not working.
- [ ] Add `nushell` support.
- [X] Fix harpoon configuration.
- [X] Fix icons for `lsp` etc.
- [X] Add shortcut to hide or turn-off cmp.
- [X] re-configure prompt to something simpler.
