# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal `nvim` config.

requirements:

- `lua` based configuration.
- `lsp` 
- `treesitter`
- `telescope` - NOTE: Install `ripgrep` to ensure `.gitignore` is respected.
- `harpoon`
- Rust, Python, HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript support. Primary language is Rust.

The editor should be "pretty" but avoid over the top highlighting and baubles.

non-requirements:

- tabs or buffer line
- tree view or file exlorer
- VSCode-like UI.

## TODO:

- [ ] Add `nushell` support. Maybe remove and revert to using `zsh`.
- [ ] Look at a better way to view the project structure. The tree model is common, is it best.
- [ ] Remove Telescope File Browser, as Oil is better.

# Working on my keyboard skills.

Okay, let's write some prose.

let some_variable = match {
some_function;
some_other_variable;
}
